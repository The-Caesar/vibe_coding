# Vibe Coding — Templates for Agent Workflows and Coding Agents

This repository is a collection of small, reusable templates designed to accelerate daily coding work focused on agent development, agent workflows, coding agents, and custom instructions. Use these templates as starting points to scaffold projects, experiment with agent behaviors, and document best practices.

What you'll find here

- Templates for building agent workflows (conversational flows, tool integrations, and orchestration).
- Example coding agent skeletons and helper utilities.
- Custom instructions and policy snippets to guide agent behavior and safety.
- README examples, minimal runners, and notes to help you bootstrap experiments quickly.

Who is this for

- Developers exploring AI agents and automation.
- Teams building reusable agent components and internal tooling.
- Folks wanting quick starter templates for prototypes and demos.

How to use

1. Browse the folders and pick a template that matches your goal.
2. Copy the template into a new project folder or clone the repository as a starter repo.
3. Edit configuration files and API keys as needed for your environment.
4. Run the minimal runner scripts (if provided) to validate the template.

Guidance & Best Practices

- Keep secrets out of the repo — use environment variables or secret managers.
- Start small: adapt a minimal template before combining multiple agents or tools.
- Add tests for critical agent behaviors and failure modes (edge cases, long conversations).

Contributing

- Feel free to add new templates or improve existing ones. Open a pull request with a short description of what the template provides and a minimal usage example.

License

- This repository uses permissive licensing by default; add a `LICENSE` file if you have a specific license preference.
